# Hi I'm Eugene 👋

As a business analyst working in data analytics within the Capital Markets industry, I find great satisfaction in working with data to solve complex business problems. I am particularly passionate about the process of data analysis itself, as it enables me to unravel complex problems and uncover meaningful insights that may not be apparent on the surface. This often involves asking the right questions, identifying patterns and trends, and connecting disparate pieces of information to uncover hidden opportunities or risks.

Additionally, I have a strong interest in Data Science and Machine Learning, which allows me to delve even deeper into data sets, uncover more intricate insights, and make predictions or recommendations based on past patterns. I believe that these techniques have enormous potential to drive business growth and innovation, and I am excited to continue exploring their possibilities.
